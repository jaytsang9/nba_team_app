# NBA Reddit

Welcome to NBA Reddit! NBA Reddit is a clone of the popular r/nba subreddit. This clone offers the same features as r/nba in both functionality and policy. While users will still have to abide by the same rules and conduct as its predecessor, users are able to enjoy the features that makes their favorite subreddit so trendy. Basketball fans can continue to contribute their insights on the lastest news around the league via submitting, liking, and commenting on posts. As an added bonus, users have access to a player dashboard to query each players' season averages for more in-depth analysis.
